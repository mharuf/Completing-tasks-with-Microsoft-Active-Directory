<h1>Configuring groups and completing basic administrative tasks with Microsoft Active Directory</h1>
In this project I learned how to perform basic administrative tasks in Microsoft Active Directory such as adding/removing users in AD, resetting locked accounts, creating groups, and adding users to those groups. I then configured the group policies of that group by modifying access to removable storage and CMD as well as enabling and defining password policies. This has been a very interesting experience as I was exposed to software that IT professionals use in their jobs and the tasks that they complete.  

This project has been split into two separate files due to the large size of the total project. Part 1 includes the administrative tasks while part 2 contains the creation of groups and configuration of group policies.
